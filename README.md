### ISAUnited Defensible 10 – Sub-Standards Repository

Welcome to the **Defensible 10 Sub-Standards** development repository.

This repository supports **open standards development** under the **ISAUnited.org** framework for technical cybersecurity architecture and engineering. All contributions follow the **Defensible Standards Schema Function (D-SSF)**, a structured, engineering-based approach for writing sub-standards aligned to the 10 Defensible Domains.

Practitioners, engineers, researchers, and standards contributors are invited to propose and submit new **sub-standards** mapped to each parent standard domain (e.g., Network Security, Cloud Security, IAM).

### 🔰 What is a Sub-Standard?

A **sub-standard** is **not** just a single control, toggle, or configuration change.

A sub-standard is a **small, focused engineering standard** that:

- Belongs under one of the 10 Defensible Parent Standards (D01–D10)
- Describes a **specific security problem or exposure**
- Proposes a **defensible way to solve it**, using:
  - Requirements (what must exist first)
  - Security Principles (the “why” behind the design)
  - Security Controls (referenced from CSA, CIS, OWASP, etc.)
  - Technical Specifications (what the system must actually do or enforce)
- Defines **how the implementation will be tested and validated (V&V)**
- Is submitted for peer review by the ISAUnited Fellows Society
Think of a sub-standard as a **mini-design document plus a verification plan**, not as a one-line “set this option to true.”

### ✅ What a Sub-Standard IS

- A **technical proposal** that can be adopted as part of ISAUnited’s Defensible Standards
- A **repeatable pattern** for solving a specific security problem
- An engineering artifact that includes:
  - Context and scope
  - Requirements and assumptions
  - Controls and implementation details
  - Testing and validation steps
- Written so **other teams or organizations can implement and verify it**, not just you

### ❌ What a Sub-Standard is NOT

- Not just a firewall rule or a Terraform snippet
- Not just “turn on MFA” or “enable TLS”
- Not a vendor-specific configuration guide or product manual
- Not a loose collection of tips or best practices

Sub-standards are meant to be **portable, auditable, and defensible** across tools, platforms, and environments.

### 📝 **New to standards?**
>
> You do NOT need to be a standards expert to contribute.
> What you need is:
> - Hands-on technical experience with a real security problem  
>   _(for example: cybersecurity architecture / engineering, IT infrastructure, cloud / DevOps, or software engineering)_
> - The willingness to document **how you’d solve it in a way others can repeat and test.**
>
> Our template and D-SSF guide will walk you through each section step by step.

### 📥 Submit a Sub-Standard

1. Register as a contributor:  
   [ISAUnited.org Registration Form](https://www.isaunited.org/isaunited-defensbile10-standards-registration)

2. Download and complete the **Sub-Standard Template (PDF)** from this repository.

3. Email the completed PDF to:
   **admin@isaunited.org**  
   _(or submit via internal upload portal if provided)_

4. Once received, ISAUnited will place the sub-standard in a private review queue for Fellows to peer review.

5. Upon approval, your sub-standard will be published here publicly under its parent domain.

> ⚠️ Submissions are NOT accepted directly through GitHub.  
> Only registered contributors may submit through the official ISAUnited process.
